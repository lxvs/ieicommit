# Johnny's Git Kit

It adds several more convenient commands to Git Bash. Open Git Bash and use command `jg` for more details.

The term Johnny Git is come from `jg`, rather than otherwise.

`jg` was chosen as the prefix of all these commands because there is hardly any built-in command that initials with `jg`.

Besides, all these commands has the unique initial after `jg`.

Therefore, for example, you can simply type `jgc` and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to get command `jgcommitnumber`.
